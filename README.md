# Spin to Win

This project is for a conference I'm hosting a booth for. I have a trivia game I've created, and I've built an LED matrix with
some controls as a way for the user to select categories and win prizes.

I've done a live stream for the creation of this project from beginning to end, that can be found here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJy1pkgHZBc&list=PLz6ht8wE2VSujYsN-sqULnGspK5Ppp12D]()

The project consists of:
- a 8 * 20 matrix of ws2818b led's
- 2 60mm big dome LED's with 1NC1NO switches
- 2 1k potentiometers
- AC to DC regulated power supply (5v up to 30A)
- microcontroller (teensy 3.6 or Arduino Due)
